# Project Reflection

## Interpreting User Needs

When it comes to interpreting user needs, I focus on really listening to what users have to say. I like to ask questions and dig deeper to understand their expectations. Gathering feedback through discussions and surveys helps me pinpoint what users want from the program. This input is super valuable, as it shapes my design decisions and ensures I create something that genuinely meets their needs.

Creating “user stories” is a big part of this process for me. By breaking down user needs into simple, relatable stories, I can capture their essence and prioritize features more effectively. It’s a great way to keep everything clear and manageable, making sure I stay on track with what users are looking for as I develop the project.

## Approach to Developing Programs

My approach to developing programs is pretty straightforward: I like to take things one step at a time. Breaking down projects into smaller tasks keeps me focused and helps prevent feeling overwhelmed. I always aim to write clean, well-documented code so that anyone can jump in and understand what’s going on.

In the future, I really want to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum into my work. I think it’s a fantastic way to stay flexible and adapt to changes while keeping the team connected. By working iteratively and continuously refining the program based on feedback, I can ensure the final product is effective and meets everyone’s expectations.

## Being a Good Team Member

To me, being a good team member in software development is all about collaboration and support. I strive to communicate openly with my teammates and provide constructive feedback. I believe that sharing ideas and resources can lead to better solutions for everyone involved.

Reliability is also key. I make it a point to complete my tasks on time and lend a helping hand to others when they need it. I know that teamwork can really boost productivity and create a positive work environment, which benefits the entire project in the long run.
